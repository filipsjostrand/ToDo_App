ToDo_App

Functionality:
- Write and add todos.
- Copy text from newly created todos (for possible storage).
- Mark todos (Check (with a strikethrough line)/uncheck) as "completed/not completed".
- Remove todos.

How use:
The project can be downloaded and the index.html opened in a browser of choice.

Comments:
- This is a basic Todo-app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- I've added functionality (from the GreatStack code base) to copy the text of newly created todos and also added a character limit of 50 characters.
