ToDo_App

A slightly updated version of application is available at: https://filipsjostrand.github.io/

Functionality:
- Add todos.
- Replace todos.
- Check todos (Check (with a strikethrough line)/uncheck) as "completed/not completed".
- Reset todos.

How-to-use:
The project can be downloaded and the index.html opened in a browser of choice.

Comments:
- This is a basic Todo-app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- I've added functionality (from the GreatStack code base) to copy the text of newly created todos and also added a character limit of 50 characters.
